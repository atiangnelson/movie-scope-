    "synopsis": "Christopher Nolan’s *Inception* (2010) is a sci-fi thriller that explores the power of dreams and the subconscious. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a skilled thief who extracts secrets from people’s minds by entering their dreams. Given a chance to erase his criminal past, he must do the impossible—plant an idea instead of stealing one. As Cobb and his team navigate dangerous, multi-layered dreamscapes, his past trauma threatens to unravel their mission. With stunning visuals, a gripping story, and a thought-provoking ending, *Inception* blurs the line between dreams and reality, leaving audiences questioning what’s real and what’s merely perception.",
